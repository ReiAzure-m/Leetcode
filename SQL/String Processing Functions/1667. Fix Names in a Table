select user_id,
        concat(upper(left(name,1)), lower(right(name, length(name)-1))) as name
from Users
order by user_id; 

--- Solution 2: substring
select user_id,
        concat(upper(substr(name, 1,1)), lower(substr(name, 2))) as name
from Users
order by user_id; 


--- Solution 3: INITCAP 
SELECT user_id, INITCAP(name) AS name FROM Users

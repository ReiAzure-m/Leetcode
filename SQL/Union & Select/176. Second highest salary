--- Approach 1: max()
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where salary not in (
    select max(salary) from Employee)

--- Approach 2: limit offset
SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1

--- Approach 3: if null
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary

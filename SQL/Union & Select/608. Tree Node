--- Approach 1: Union (faster)
select id, 'Root' as type
from tree
where p_id is null

union

select id, 'Leaf' as type
from tree
where id not in (
    select distinct p_id 
    from tree
    where p_id is not null)
    and p_id is not null

union

select id, 'Inner' as type
from tree
where id in (
    select distinct p_id
    from tree
    where p_id is not null)
    and p_id is not null
    
--- Approach 2: case when (fewer lines)
select id,
case
    when p_id is null then 'Root'
    when id not in (
        select distinct p_id from tree where p_id is not null)
        then 'Leaf'
    else 'Inner'
end as type
from tree
order by id
